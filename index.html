    X- do-while will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false
    -  while loops have an extra variable that gets compared
2. Which of these is NOT a correct way to define a function?
    - function codeQuizAnswers() { };
    X- var function() = codeQuizAnswers { };
    - var codeQuizAnswers = () => { };
    - const codeQuizAnswers = function() { };
3. Which of these is a difference between a function declaration and expression?
    - a function declaration has the ability to call an array as an argument
    X- a function expression cannot be hoisted (ran before reaching it in the code)
    - a function expression can be used to call two or more variables as arguments
    - a declaration has the word function typed later than in an expression
4. What does dot notation allow the programmer to achieve?
    - borrow the value of a relative expression
    X- access an object's values or methods
    - check the value of more than one consecutive arguments
    - compare two variables in a logical assessment as an 'or' operator

    X- define a method inside an object
    - access properties inside an object
    - setting values inside an array with single quotations
6.  What is the purpose of the javascript function JSON.stringify()?
    - combines an array into a string with certain criteria
    - parse a string into integers 
    - parse a string into a value or object 
    X- convert an object to a string
7.  What is the purpose of the % operator?  
    X- to return the remainder left over when one is divided by another
    - to round out the effect of Math.floor
    - to convert a division equation to a numerical percentage
    - to signify 'or' as a logical operator
8.  What does event.target signify?
    - the outcome of operating on an array
    X- the target of an action such as a form submit or button click  
    - sets the target attribute of an element on the page
    - define a variable as an element of the DOM
9.  What would typically be used to include a button on the page?
    -  an if-then statement
    -  a Math.random operator
    X- an addEventListener("click", 'function');
    -  a document.querySelector
10. Where would an event.preventDefault() typically be used?
    X- to prevent a submit form from refreshing the page
    - to prevent a for loop from an infinite return
    - to allow a button to be clicked only once
    - to make a textarea prompt read-only
11. How do you access the index of an array?
    - arr.index[3]
    X- arr[3]
    - arr{3}
    - arr("3")
12. What is console.dir used for?
    - to read out the indicies of an array
    - to render a text area on the page via CSS
    - to read out the text contents of the argument in the console
    X- to see properties of a specified javascript object
13. Which of these is not true concerning a switch statement?
    - a break; needs to be called to prompt the next case
